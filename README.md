# orgreport
This is a project that I worked on as a group. It is a website used for reporting misconduct in clubs, organizations, and greek life at UVA. I contributed to frontend and backend code for the website. My main contribution included my role as devops, keeping heroku, django, github, and aws stable and connected in order for our website to run smoothly.
